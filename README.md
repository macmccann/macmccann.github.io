# Hey there!

If you're reading this, you've managed to find the repo behind my personal site, macmccann.github.io. This is a work in progress,
and when finished it should contain:

 - my resume/projects
 - a contact page
 - a music blog
 - a coding blog
 - a blog about mobile apps

If you'd like to get in touch with me, feel free to email me at johnwilfredmccann@gmail.com.

Thanks!
